### **About The Project** 💡

Static portfolios are a thing of the past. They present a one-sided, lifeless view of a developer's journey. 
This project is an **AI-powered, interactive portfolio** that transforms the "About Me" page into a dynamic, engaging conversation. Instead of forcing recruiters, developers, and friends to scroll endlessly through information, it invites them to ask questions and receive answers tailored specifically to them.  

It’s a portfolio that doesn't just show—it communicates.

---

### **Features** ✨

*   **🗣️ Interactive AI Avatar:** Engage in real-time conversation. Ask anything from my tech stack to my hobbies and get instant, context-aware answers.
*   **🧠 Context-Aware Engine:** The AI's personality and responses adapt based on who it's talking to—whether you're a recruiter, a fellow developer, or a friend.
*   **🎨 Dynamic & Responsive UI:** A sleek, modern interface built with TailwindCSS and brought to life with Framer Motion animations.
*   **🚀 Built for Everyone:** Crafted to provide a unique experience for tech recruiters, potential collaborators, and curious friends alike.
*   **💬 No More Boring Bios:** This portfolio talks *back*.
