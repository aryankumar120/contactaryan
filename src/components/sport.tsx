          Before I dove deep into development, I was speeding through life quite literally on skates 🛼. I’ve been skating since childhood and even made it to the national level. It taught me discipline, balance, and how to keep moving forward no matter the bumps (or bruises).

          My love for sports didn’t stop there. I’ve proudly captained my college snooker team 🎱—snooker’s actually my all-time favorite. It's a game of precision, patience, and strategy, basically debugging, but with more chalk and cooler posture.

          On the virtual side of things, I was also part of a professional esports team 🎮. It’s high-speed, high-pressure, and weirdly similar to deploying a complex AI model with zero margin for error.

          When I’m not leading code or cue sports, you’ll catch me on a bike ride 🏍️—it’s my way to chase the thrill and hit pause on the chaos. Two wheels, open roads, and some deep thinking time works every time.
        </p>
        <p>
          And just for fun? I enjoy a game of badminton 🏸, a match of football ⚽, or a thoughtful round of chess ♟️. Win or lose, it’s all part of staying sharp mentally and physically.
