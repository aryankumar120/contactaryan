          Before I dove deep into development, I was speeding through life quite literally travelling here and there 🏔️. I’ve been roaming since childhood and love to meet people and listen to them share them. It taught me discipline, paitence, and how to keep moving forward no matter the bumps (or bruises).

          And just for fun? I enjoy a game of cricket 🏏, a match of biking 🏍️. Win or lose, it’s all part of staying sharp mentally and physically.
